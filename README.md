Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:


1) Iris Flower Classification Description: The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

# Iris Flower Classification 

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This project aims to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. This is a classic introductory machine learning problem and a great way to get started with data science.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset that contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample having the following features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
- **Species** (Target variable: Iris-Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

### Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Implement a classification algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on the features.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Project Structure

- **Iris_classifcation_project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project code, including data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.

## Summary 

This project includes several visualizations to help understand the relationships between features. For example, the scatter plot above shows the relationship between sepal length and sepal width for each species.

Model Evaluation
The model used in this project was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. The final model achieved an accuracy of X%.

## Conclusion
The Iris Flower Classification project successfully demonstrates basic data science workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning about classification tasks in machine learning.

I have used K-nearest neighbor and Logistic regression models for this project in which I have achieved an accuracy or 96.67% and 95% respectively to classify the test data of the Flower type
